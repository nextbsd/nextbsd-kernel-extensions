 * FreeBSD glue for vc4_firmware_kms (nextbsd-kernel#176).
 *
 * The driver talks to the VideoCore firmware over the property mailbox, which
 * FreeBSD already implements -- this maps the three rpi_firmware_* entry
 * points onto it. Same mailbox, same tags, different spelling.
 *
 * Worth recording why this file has to exist at all rather than the driver
 * just working: the vendored raspberrypi-firmware.h gates its declarations on
 * IS_ENABLED(CONFIG_RASPBERRYPI_FIRMWARE), and with that undefined the header
 * supplies static inlines returning -ENOSYS. The compile probe therefore went
 * green on all 11 rpi_firmware_* call sites while binding them to stubs. The
 * Makefile now defines CONFIG_RASPBERRYPI_FIRMWARE, which is what makes these
 * definitions the ones that get used.
