 * Upstream v3d_sysfs.c exports one attribute group: per-queue GPU usage
 * counters under /sys/devices/.../gpu_stats. It is built on sysfs_create_group()
 * and struct device_attribute, neither of which LinuxKPI provides in a form
 * that would put files anywhere a FreeBSD userland looks.
 *
 * So the file is not vendored, and these stand in for the two entry points
 * v3d_drv.c calls unconditionally -- they are NOT inside a CONFIG_ guard the
 * way .debugfs_init is, so leaving them undefined would be a link error rather
 * than a compiled-out call.
 *
 * v3d_sysfs_init() returning 0 is correct rather than convenient: its failure
 * path in probe unwinds the whole driver, and there is nothing here that can
 * fail. The statistics themselves are still gathered by v3d_sched.c -- only
 * the reporting surface is missing, and a sysctl for it is the obvious follow-up
 * once the driver runs.
