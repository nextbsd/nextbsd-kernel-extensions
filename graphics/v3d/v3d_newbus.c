/*
 * newbus shim for the v3d GPU driver (nextbsd-kernel-extensions#66).
 *
 * v3d is vendored unmodified from raspberrypi/linux rpi-6.12.y, where it is a
 * Linux platform driver. LinuxKPI has no platform bus for it to bind to, so
 * this attaches to the device-tree node and calls the vendored probe -- the
 * same arrangement vc4_newbus.c uses for the display blocks.
 *
 * SIMPLER THAN THE DISPLAY SIDE, in one way that matters: vc4 is a component
 * driver, so each block registers with component_add() and nothing comes up
 * until a master's match list is complete. v3d is a single device that owns
 * one drm_device. Its probe registers the render node directly, so when this
 * returns the GPU is up or it is not -- there is no deferred bind to reason
 * about, and no BUS_PASS ordering against a master.
 *
 * The glue is duplicated from vc4_newbus.c rather than shared. That is
 * deliberate for now: vc4_kms is working and shipping, and #67 had to untangle
 * a `.PATH` that reached into another module's directory. Hoisting this into
 * graphics/lkpi/ is the right refactor once v3d works, not while it is being
 * brought up.
