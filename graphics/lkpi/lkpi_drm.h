 *
 * so this is pulled in ahead of every source in the module, and it includes

 * what is missing.
 *
 * That is deliberate. The obvious alternative -- shipping our own

 * same header for this module and silently drop whatever drm-kmod had added
 * to it. That mistake broke `drm-kmod build` on both arches earlier in #51,
 * when lkpi/linux/{dma-mapping,mm,iosys-map}.h shadowed drm-kmod's versions.
 * The rule that came out of it: only shadow a header whose consumers are all
 * inside this module. dma-fence.h and drm_managed.h are drm core; they are
 * not.
 *
 * The earlier attempt at this (closed PR #56) patched drm-kmod instead. Two of
 * its three pieces did not need to -- they add functions, not struct members --
