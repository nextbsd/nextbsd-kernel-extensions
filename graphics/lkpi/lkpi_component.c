 * components in match order" -- and vc4 depends on it.
 *
 * Concretely, from the vc4 port (nextbsd-kernel-extensions#51):
 * vc4_crtc_bind() calls vc4_set_crtc_possible_masks(), which walks the
 * encoders ALREADY REGISTERED on the drm_device and sets
 * encoder->possible_crtcs. If a pixelvalve (CRTC) binds before the HDMI
 * encoders exist, that walk finds nothing, nothing revisits it, and the HDMI
 * encoders keep possible_crtcs == 0 -- DRM then has no CRTC able to drive the
 * HDMI connectors, fbdev finds no usable CRTC, and every modeset fails. The
 * driver loads "successfully" and the display is silently dead.
 *
 * That is not hypothetical on a Pi 5: bcm2712's device tree lists the
 * pixelvalves (0x7c410000, 0x7c411000) before the HDMI controllers
 * (0x7ef00700, 0x7ef05700), so registration order puts both CRTCs ahead of
 * both encoders on every boot.
 *
 * A master with no match list keeps the old behaviour -- bind everything in
 * registration order -- which is the single-component case this framework was
 * originally written for.
