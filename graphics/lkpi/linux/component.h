 * The component framework, in the subset a single-device driver needs
 * (nextbsd-kernel#176).
 *
 * Linux uses this to defer binding until every sub-device of a multi-part
 * device has registered, then bind them together as one logical device. A
 * component calls component_add() from its probe and does nothing else; the
 * master calls component_bind_all() once it is ready.
 *
 * That is exactly the shape this implements, and no more: no match arrays, no
 * aggregate driver, no deferred probe. A driver whose parts all attach from
 * one FreeBSD device tree node has nothing to wait for, so the master drives
 * the sequence directly.
 *
 * Note there is a zero-length linux/component.h in compat/linuxkpi/dummy,
 * which resolves silently for anything that only needs the include to exist.
 * The common tree comes first in the include path, so this file wins for
 * anything that actually calls these.

/*
 * MODULE-LOCAL LinuxKPI (nextbsd-kernel-extensions#51).
 *
 * This header shadows the kernel's <linux/component.h>. Every drm-kmod module is
 * built with its own include paths ahead of the kernel's:
 *
 *	-I linuxkpi/gplv2/include			drm-kmod's own KPI
 *	-I linuxkpi/bsd/include				drm-kmod's own KPI
 *	-I ${SYSDIR}/compat/linuxkpi/common/include	the kernel's
 *
 * and this module puts -I${.CURDIR}/lkpi ahead of all of them, so what
 * follows is seen ONLY by objects compiled into this module. drm.ko, i915,
 * amdgpu and the kernel itself are untouched.
 *
 * That isolation is the entire point. Eleven of the kernel's LinuxKPI patches
 * touched shared headers and both regressions we have had came from those
 * eleven -- an include collision that broke the whole amdgpu build, and a
 * struct device field that broke KBI for every already-built module. This
 * code carries the same risk and none of the blast radius.
 *
 * The kernel still exports its own component_add(), of_match_device() and so
 * on, from patch 0040, which firmware KMS runs on. Ours would collide at load
 * time, so every function this module provides is renamed to vc4lkpi_* below
 * and the Linux spelling is #defined onto it. Vendored sources keep calling
 * the Linux names; the preprocessor renames the definitions in our .c files
 * for free, because they include this header too.
 */


/*
 * Symbols are prefixed PER MODULE.
 *
 * Both vc4_fkms and vc4_kms compile this code, and both are built with
 * EXPORT_SYMS=YES, so a fixed prefix would collide the moment the second one
 * loaded. LKPI_PFX comes from each Makefile (-DLKPI_PFX=vc4kms_), so each
 * module carries its own copy under its own names. They are also independent
 * at runtime -- separate component lists, separate masters -- which is what we
 * want: one driver's bind cannot disturb the other's.
