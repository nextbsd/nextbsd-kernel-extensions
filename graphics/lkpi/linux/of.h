/*
 * MODULE-LOCAL LinuxKPI (nextbsd-kernel-extensions#51).
 *
 * This header shadows the kernel's <linux/of.h>. Every drm-kmod module is
 * built with its own include paths ahead of the kernel's:
 *
 *	-I linuxkpi/gplv2/include			drm-kmod's own KPI
 *	-I linuxkpi/bsd/include				drm-kmod's own KPI
 *	-I ${SYSDIR}/compat/linuxkpi/common/include	the kernel's
 *
 * and this module puts -I${.CURDIR}/lkpi ahead of all of them, so what
 * follows is seen ONLY by objects compiled into this module. drm.ko, i915,
 * amdgpu and the kernel itself are untouched.
 *
 * That isolation is the entire point. Eleven of the kernel's LinuxKPI patches
 * touched shared headers and both regressions we have had came from those
 * eleven -- an include collision that broke the whole amdgpu build, and a
 * struct device field that broke KBI for every already-built module. This
 * code carries the same risk and none of the blast radius.
 *
 * The kernel still exports its own component_add(), of_match_device() and so
 * on, from patch 0040, which firmware KMS runs on. Ours would collide at load
 * time, so every function this module provides is renamed to vc4lkpi_* below
 * and the Linux spelling is #defined onto it. Vendored sources keep calling
 * the Linux names; the preprocessor renames the definitions in our .c files
 * for free, because they include this header too.
 */


/*
 * Symbols are prefixed PER MODULE.
 *
 * Both vc4_fkms and vc4_kms compile this code, and both are built with
 * EXPORT_SYMS=YES, so a fixed prefix would collide the moment the second one
 * loaded. LKPI_PFX comes from each Makefile (-DLKPI_PFX=vc4kms_), so each
 * module carries its own copy under its own names. They are also independent
 * at runtime -- separate component lists, separate masters -- which is what we
 * want: one driver's bind cannot disturb the other's.

 * Upstream Linux keeps this in struct device as dev->of_node, and we used to
 * do the same: kernel patch 0040 inserted the field into LinuxKPI's struct
 * device. That was a mistake with real consequences. The insert was
 * mid-struct, so devt, class, release, kobj, dma_priv and irq all shifted by
 * eight bytes -- and because struct pci_dev embeds struct device first, every
 * pci_dev member shifted too. Any module built before the change read its
 * fields eight bytes low. A Dell Wyse 5070 page-faulted in device_attach()
 * loading i915kms with a kernel 22 hours newer than its kexts
 * (gershwin-desktop#49). Nothing about that failure involved vc4.
 *
 * So the field is gone from the kernel and the mapping lives here instead,
 * private to this module. dev_of_node() IS a real upstream accessor
 * (include/linux/device.h), so vendored sources using it rather than the bare
 * field is idiomatic, not a deviation.

 * The table is tiny and set up at attach: a vc4 pipeline is five devices.
