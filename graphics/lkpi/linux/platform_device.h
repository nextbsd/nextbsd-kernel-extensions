/*
 * MODULE-LOCAL LinuxKPI (nextbsd-kernel-extensions#51).
 *
 * This header shadows the kernel's <linux/platform_device.h>. Every drm-kmod module is
 * built with its own include paths ahead of the kernel's:
 *
 *	-I linuxkpi/gplv2/include			drm-kmod's own KPI
 *	-I linuxkpi/bsd/include				drm-kmod's own KPI
 *	-I ${SYSDIR}/compat/linuxkpi/common/include	the kernel's
 *
 * and this module puts -I${.CURDIR}/lkpi ahead of all of them, so what
 * follows is seen ONLY by objects compiled into this module. drm.ko, i915,
 * amdgpu and the kernel itself are untouched.
 *
 * That isolation is the entire point. Eleven of the kernel's LinuxKPI patches
 * touched shared headers and both regressions we have had came from those
 * eleven -- an include collision that broke the whole amdgpu build, and a
 * struct device field that broke KBI for every already-built module. This
 * code carries the same risk and none of the blast radius.
 *
 * The kernel still exports its own component_add(), of_match_device() and so
 * on, from patch 0040, which firmware KMS runs on. Ours would collide at load
 * time, so every function this module provides is renamed to vc4lkpi_* below
 * and the Linux spelling is #defined onto it. Vendored sources keep calling
 * the Linux names; the preprocessor renames the definitions in our .c files
 * for free, because they include this header too.
 */

/*
 * Encoding for interrupts of a device on a bus LinuxKPI did not attach.
 *
 * The PCI path maps a Linux irq number back to a resource rid; off PCI there
 * is no such mapping, so request_irq() uses rid 0 and a device can hold only
 * one interrupt. bcm2712 needs more -- the HVS requests three named interrupts
 * (ch0..2-eof) and HDMI four (hpd-connected, hpd-removed, cec-rx, cec-tx) --
 * and vc4_hvs.c does not check the return, so a second request fails silently
 * with every handler aliased to one line.
 *
 * platform_get_irq()/platform_get_irq_byname() therefore return the rid tagged
 * with LKPI_IRQ_OF. The tag sits far above any real interrupt number, so an
 * untagged value still means "dev->irq, rid 0".
 *
 * NOTE: consuming the tag requires request_irq() to honour it, which lives in
 * the kernel's linux_interrupt.c. Until that is addressed module-side, a
 * driver asking for a second interrupt gets a tagged rid the kernel's
 * request_irq() will not understand -- so multi-IRQ is declared here but not
 * yet functional end to end (#51).
