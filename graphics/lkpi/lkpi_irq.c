 * More than one interrupt per device-tree device
 * (nextbsd-kernel-extensions#51).
 *
 * LinuxKPI's request_irq() finds its device with lkpi_pci_find_irq_dev(),
 * which searches the PCI list. Kernel patch 0044 added a fallback so a
 * device-tree device can register at all, but that fallback allocates rid 0
 * unconditionally -- one interrupt per device, no more.
 *
 * bcm2712 needs more than one. The HVS requests three named interrupts
 * (ch0-eof, ch1-eof, ch2-eof) and on gen6 those ARE vblank:
 * vc6_hvs_eof_irq_handler, gated by eof_irq[channel].enabled through
 * vc4_hvs_irq_enable_eof(). The HDMI controller requests four more
 * (hpd-connected, hpd-removed, cec-rx, cec-tx).
 *
 * And the failure is silent. vc4_hvs.c assigns devm_request_irq()'s return to
 * ret and never checks it before storing the descriptor, so with a single rid
 * the second and third requests fail quietly and all three handlers end up
 * aliased to one line: mis-wired vblank, not absent vblank.
 *
 * So platform_get_irq()/platform_get_irq_byname() return the resource rid
 * tagged with LKPI_IRQ_OF, and this allocates exactly that rid. Anything
 * untagged is handed to the kernel's lkpi_request_irq() unchanged -- the
 * firmware-KMS path is byte-for-byte what it was, which matters because that
 * is the driver that currently works.

 * Linux handlers return irqreturn_t and take (irq, arg); newbus wants a void
 * filter taking a single cookie. This adapts one to the other.
 *
 * The filter does no work beyond scheduling the ithread. An earlier version
 * ran the Linux primary handler here, reasoning that Linux's primary/threaded
 * split maps onto newbus's filter/ithread split. It does not, and the
 * difference is not cosmetic:
 *
 *   - On Linux a primary handler may take a spinlock_t, because that is a
 *     genuine non-sleeping spinlock.
 *   - LinuxKPI implements spinlock_t as a struct mtx of type MTX_DEF, which
 *     is adaptive: under contention mtx_lock() spins only while the owner is
 *     running, and otherwise SLEEPS.
 *   - A newbus filter runs in primary interrupt context and must never sleep.
 *
 * So any Linux primary handler that takes a lock is illegal as a filter, and
 * essentially all of them do. v3d_irq() calls dma_fence_signal(), which takes
 * fence->lock, and that deadlocked a Pi 500+ desktop -- whichever thread the
 * interrupt happened to land on was switched out inside the handler and never
 * resumed:
 *
 *	mi_switch / __mtx_lock_sleep / dma_fence_signal / v3d_irq
 *	/ lkpi_of_irq_filter / intr_event_handle / handle_el0_irq
 *
 * Note handle_el0_irq: the victim was in userspace, minding its own business.
 *
 * Running both halves on the ithread costs a little interrupt latency and
 * makes sleeping legal, which is what the Linux code assumes it may do.
