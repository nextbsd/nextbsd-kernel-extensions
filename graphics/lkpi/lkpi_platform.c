 * The platform-device registry (nextbsd-kernel-extensions#51).

 * LinuxKPI has no platform bus. vc4's master builds its component match list
 * by asking, for each entry in component_drivers[], which devices are bound to
 * that driver -- platform_find_device_by_driver(). With no bus there was
 * nothing to answer with, and the function was deliberately left undefined so
 * the build would fail rather than quietly produce an empty match list.
 *
 * That caution was right. An empty match list is COMPLETE by definition, so
 * the master binds immediately with zero components, reports success, and
 * leaves the display dark -- a failure that points nowhere near its cause.
 *
 * The newbus shims already build one struct platform_device per attached
 * block, so the registry is just those: recorded at attach, removed at detach.
 * A vc4 pipeline is five devices, so a list is the right shape.
