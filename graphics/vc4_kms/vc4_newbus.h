 * unmodified from raspberrypi/linux and registers itself as a Linux platform
 * driver. LinuxKPI has no platform bus for those to bind to
 * (platform_driver_register() is a stub returning -ENXIO), so each block gets
 * a newbus driver that attaches to its device-tree node and calls the vendored
 * probe itself. That is the arrangement vc4_fkms_master.c already uses on
 * hardware.
 *
 * The three shims differ only in which platform_driver they wrap and what to
 * call the device, so the work lives here and each shim is its DEVMETHOD table
 * plus one line of each callback.
