 * newbus shim for vc4_hdmi_driver (nextbsd-kernel-extensions#51).
 *
 * The HDMI controller and its PHY. A Pi 5 has two, hdmi0 and hdmi1, matched by
 * separate compatible strings with different .data.
 *
 * Note its driver declares .pm = &vc4_hdmi_pm_ops. LinuxKPI implements no
 * runtime PM, so those callbacks are never invoked; the block stays powered,
 * which is correct-but-wasteful rather than broken.
 *
 * All the work is in vc4_newbus.c; this is the DEVMETHOD table and the name.
 * vc4_hdmi_driver is non-static in the vendored source, so its .probe and
 * .remove_new are reachable without editing that file.

 * The master builds its component match list at probe by asking the
 * platform-device registry which devices are bound to each driver in
 * component_drivers[]. A component that has not attached yet is not in that
 * registry and does not make the list.
 *
 * That is not a "binds later" situation. An empty or short match list is
 * COMPLETE by definition, so the master binds immediately with whatever it
 * found -- possibly nothing -- registers a drm_device with no CRTCs, and
 * reports success. The screen stays dark and nothing logs an error.
 *
 * So every component attaches in an earlier newbus pass than the master.
