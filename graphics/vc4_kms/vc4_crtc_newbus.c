 * newbus shim for vc4_crtc_driver (nextbsd-kernel-extensions#51).
 *
 * The pixelvalve: takes composited pixels from the HVS and drives them out with
 * the display timings. One per output; a Pi 5 has two.
 *
 * Its match table carries per-variant .data (bcm2712_pv0_data and friends),
 * which the vendored probe recovers with of_device_get_match_data() -- so the
 * right register layout depends on that helper working, not just on matching.
 *
 * All the work is in vc4_newbus.c; this is the DEVMETHOD table and the name.
 * vc4_crtc_driver is non-static in the vendored source, so its .probe and
 * .remove_new are reachable without editing that file.

 * platform-device registry which devices are bound to each driver in
 * component_drivers[]. A component that has not attached yet is not in that
 * registry and does not make the list.
 *
 * That is not a "binds later" situation. An empty or short match list is
 * COMPLETE by definition, so the master binds immediately with whatever it
 * found -- possibly nothing -- registers a drm_device with no CRTCs, and
 * reports success. The screen stays dark and nothing logs an error.
 *
 * So every component attaches in an earlier newbus pass than the master.
