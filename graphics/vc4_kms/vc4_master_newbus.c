 * newbus master for the full vc4 KMS pipeline
 * (nextbsd-kernel-extensions#51).
 *
 * Attaches to the top-level vc4 device-tree node, builds the struct device the
 * vendored master expects, and hands off to vc4_platform_drm_probe(), which
 * registers vc4_drm_ops as a component master. When every component has
 * registered -- HVS, CRTC, HDMI, each via its own newbus shim -- the master's
 * bind runs and brings up the drm_device.
 *
 * This is the same arrangement vc4_fkms_master.c uses for firmware KMS, and
 * the reason neither needs LinuxKPI's platform bus.
 *
 * BINDING ORDER
 *
 * The vendored source annotates component_drivers[] with:
 *
 *	The HDMI driver needs to be bound after the HVS so that we can lookup
 *	the HVS maximum core clock rate and figure out if we support 4kp60 or
 *	not.
 *
 * That comment is STALE on rpi-6.12.y and should not be used to reason about
 * this: the 4kp60 decision moved into vc4_hvs_bind(), which asks the firmware
 * mailbox directly, and every remaining vc4->hvs use in vc4_hdmi.c is a
 * runtime callback that cannot run before drm_dev_register().
 *
 * The constraint that IS real is encoder-before-CRTC. vc4_crtc_bind() calls
 * vc4_set_crtc_possible_masks(), which walks the encoders ALREADY REGISTERED
 * on the drm_device and sets encoder->possible_crtcs. Nothing revisits it. If
 * a pixelvalve binds before the HDMI encoders exist, those encoders keep
 * possible_crtcs == 0, DRM has no CRTC able to drive the HDMI connectors,
 * fbdev finds no usable CRTC, and every modeset fails while the driver reports
 * a successful load.
 *
 * bcm2712's device tree is in exactly that order -- pixelvalves at 0x7c410000
 * and 0x7c411000 come before the HDMI controllers at 0x7ef00700 and
 * 0x7ef05700 -- so binding in registration order would hit this on every boot.
 *
 * It is handled in the KPI rather than here: component_bind_all() binds in
 * the master's match-list order, the way upstream's
 * drivers/base/component.c does (nextbsd-kernel#199). This master therefore
 * only has to build its match list in component_drivers[] order, which
 * vc4_match_add_drivers() already does.
