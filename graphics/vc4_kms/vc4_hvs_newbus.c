 * platform-device registry which devices are bound to each driver in
 * component_drivers[]. A component that has not attached yet is not in that
 * registry and does not make the list.
 *
 * That is not a "binds later" situation. An empty or short match list is
 * COMPLETE by definition, so the master binds immediately with whatever it
 * found -- possibly nothing -- registers a drm_device with no CRTCs, and
 * reports success. The screen stays dark and nothing logs an error.
 *
 * So every component attaches in an earlier newbus pass than the master.
