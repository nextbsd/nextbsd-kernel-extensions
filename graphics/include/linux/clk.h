 * linux/clk.h -- over FreeBSD's clk(9) framework
 * (nextbsd-kernel-extensions#51).
 *
 * This header was deliberately empty for firmware KMS, and its own comment
 * recorded why and predicted this file:
 *
 *	the firmware owns the pixel clock and never exposes it, which is the
 *	whole reason this driver is tractable where full vc4 is not. [...] If a
 *	future consumer needs real clk support, this file is the place, and its
 *	emptiness is a measurement rather than an oversight.
 *
 * That consumer is the full vc4 KMS display pipeline, which programs the pixel
 * clock itself instead of asking the firmware. A compile probe of it measured
 * nine clk_* calls across five entry points, which is what this implements --
 * no more, so that the next gap is a compile error rather than a silent stub.
 *
 * FreeBSD has the whole framework already in dev/clk/clk.h; the work here is
 * spelling, plus two genuine differences called out at their definitions:
 * ownership of the returned handle, and what "min rate" means.

 * Set a rate the way Linux does (#51).
 *
 * FreeBSD refuses to retune a clock whose enable_cnt exceeds the count the
 * caller claims to hold -- clk_set_freq() asserts exactly one reference -- so
 * that one consumer cannot move a rate out from under another. vc4_hdmi holds
 * TWO references on the HDMI state machine clock, one taken in
 * vc5_hdmi_init_resources() and one in runtime resume, and then asks for a
 * rate. The guard fires and the modeset fails:
 *
 *	vc40: [drm] *ERROR* Failed to set HSM clock rate: -16
 *
 * with hw.clock.rpifw-m2mc.enable_cnt reading 2, measured on a Pi 500+. The
 * rate then stays 0, the HDMI PHY never gets a pixel clock, and the display
 * stays dark while everything else reports success.
 *
 * Linux has no such rule: clk_set_rate() simply sets the rate, and a driver
 * wanting the strict behaviour asks for it explicitly with
 * clk_set_rate_exclusive(). So the Linux contract is the permissive one, and
 * these are LinuxKPI entry points.
 *
 * The normal path is left exactly as it was -- clk_set_freq() first, one
 * reference asserted. Only EBUSY is handled, by reissuing through
 * clknode_set_freq() with an ownership count that covers every outstanding
 * reference. That is safe here because the references belong to one driver:
 * vc4 is the only consumer of these display clocks. It would NOT be safe on a
 * clock genuinely shared between drivers, which is what the guard is for, so
 * this deliberately does not lift the guard globally -- it only declines to
 * apply it to a caller that already holds everything.
