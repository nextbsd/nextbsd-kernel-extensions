 * linux/gpio/consumer.h (nextbsd-kernel-extensions#51).

 * vc4_hdmi.c uses two symbols, both for the HDMI hotplug-detect line on parts
 * where HPD is wired to a GPIO rather than read from the HDMI block.
 *
 * These return "no GPIO present", which makes the driver fall back to reading
 * hotplug from the controller -- the path a Pi 5 takes anyway, since 2712
 * routes HPD through the HDMI block. So this is honest for the hardware in
 * question and NOT a general GPIO implementation.
 *
 * A board that really does wire HPD to a GPIO would silently never detect a
 * display with these stubs. If that turns up, this file is where a real
 * consumer over FreeBSD's gpio(4) belongs -- like linux/clk.h before it, the
 * emptiness here is a measurement of what BCM2712 needs, not an oversight.
