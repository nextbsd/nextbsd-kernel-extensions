/*
 * LinuxKPI virtio shim -- the Linux <linux/virtio.h> API on top of FreeBSD's
 * native virtio bus (dev/virtio/).
 *
 * FreeBSD base has no linuxkpi virtio at all, which is what has kept every
 * Linux virtio driver -- virtio-gpu first among them -- off drm-kmod. The
 * shim exists because FreeBSD's public virtqueue KPI already covers what the
 * Linux one does, only spelled differently and with the notify decision made
 * inside virtqueue_notify() rather than split across kick_prepare/notify:
 *
 *   Linux                        FreeBSD
 *   ---------------------------  ------------------------------------------
 *   virtqueue_add_sgs()          virtqueue_enqueue() + a hand-built sglist
 *   virtqueue_kick_prepare()     folded into virtqueue_notify()
 *   virtqueue_notify()           virtqueue_notify()
 *   virtqueue_get_buf()          virtqueue_dequeue()
 *   virtqueue_enable_cb()        virtqueue_enable_intr()   (inverted sense)
 *   virtqueue_disable_cb()       virtqueue_disable_intr()
 *   virtio_has_feature()         virtio_with_feature()     (bit vs mask)
 *   virtio_cread_le()            virtio_read_device_config()
 *   virtio_find_vqs()            virtio_alloc_virtqueues() + virtio_setup_intr()
 *   vdev->config->del_vqs()      virtio_stop() (the bus frees the queues)
 *
 * Deliberately NOT general: this covers the calls virtio-gpu makes and no
 * more. Growing it for a second driver is expected; guessing at that driver's
 * needs now is not.
 *
 * struct virtqueue is spelled `lkpi_virtqueue` and macro-renamed below. This
 * is not cosmetic. FreeBSD's dev/virtio/virtqueue.h forward-declares
 * `struct virtqueue` and every one of its functions takes that pointer. If the
 * Linux-side struct kept the same tag, a translation unit seeing both would
 * find them silently type-compatible, and handing FreeBSD our wrapper where it
 * expects its own queue compiles clean and corrupts the ring at run time.
