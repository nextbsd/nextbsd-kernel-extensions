# nvidia-activate.sh — wire one installed NVIDIA<NNN>.bundle's userland into the
# canonical /usr/local paths so X (auto-detect), ld.so, GLVND, and Vulkan find it.
# The bundle is version-locked storage that co-exists per-branch on disk; this makes
# exactly one branch "live" by symlinking its entry points into the standard search
# locations. Idempotent (ln -sf). Ships inside every bundle (copied by nvidia-mkbundle.sh).
#
# Single-branch systems: run once at package-build/stage time (the symlinks ship in
# NextBSD-kernel-extensions). Multi-branch later: the install/boot activator calls this
# for whichever branch autoloaded (PCI-id/kext-keyed), swapping the canonical symlinks.
#
# The symlink TARGETS are the bundle's absolute final install path (arg 1), so they
# resolve after install regardless of any staging prefix (arg 2). Portable POSIX sh.
# usage: nvidia-activate.sh <installed-bundle-path> [dest-root]
#   <installed-bundle-path>  final abs path, e.g. /System/Library/Extensions/NVIDIA595.bundle
#   [dest-root]              optional prefix for where the /usr/local links are written
