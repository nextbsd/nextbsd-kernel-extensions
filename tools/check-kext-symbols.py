"""check-kext-symbols.py — fail the build when a kext would fail kldload.

    usage: check-kext-symbols.py <kernel-elf> <kexts-dir>

A kernel module links with undefined symbols left dangling; they are resolved
at kldload time against the kernel and the modules already loaded. So a .ko can
build perfectly and still be dead on arrival: link_elf finds a symbol it cannot
resolve, and kldload returns ENOEXEC ("Exec format error") with the actual
symbol name buried in dmesg.

That is not hypothetical here. drm-kmod carries drm_format_helper.c in its tree,
EXPORT_SYMBOLs and all, but names it in no Makefile -- so
drm_format_conv_state_{init,copy,release} exist in source and in no .ko. Adding
the shadow-plane helpers (which embed a drm_format_conv_state) therefore
produced a drm_extra_helpers.ko that compiled clean, packaged clean, validated
clean, and then bricked the whole graphics stack at boot: IOGraphicsExtras
failed to load, and BochsGraphics went down with it because it depends on it.
Cost: one full CI cycle to find out, and the answer was only in a dmesg dump
the test had already exited before printing.

This closes that gap at build time. Every undefined symbol in every kext must be
satisfied by the kernel or by another kext in the same set. Cheap (a few hundred
ms), stdlib-only (no pyelftools on the toolchain image), and it fails with the
symbol name rather than an errno.
